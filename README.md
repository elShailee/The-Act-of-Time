## Description

This web game is a students project, worked by several students from the Open University of Israel. <br />
We created this project in order to have a real-life experience in coding, from learning relevant coding languages to collaborating with other developers.<br />
This project WAS NOT created by a team of experienced developers, but as a platform for us to learn how to become such.<br />
